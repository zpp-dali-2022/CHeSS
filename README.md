### Project description

This project is an attempt at applying U-Net-based architectures for the detection and segmentation of coronal holes (CHs).
The training set is created from the Heliophysics Knowledge Based (HEK) using the results of the [SPOCA algorithm](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2014/01/aa21243-13/aa21243-13.html).
Human intervention intervienes on top of the SPOCA results to refine the boundaries according to the accepted phenomenology that defines CHs.
Therefore, our Deep Learning architecture is not learning directly from the SPOCA results, but from an augmented training set that is closer to the ground truth.
This minimizes the risk of learning biases inherent to the SPOCA algorithm.

The graph below illustrates one of our UNet architectures:

# DALI contributions
## Prerequisites
Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Export path to your data:
```
export DATA_PATH=/home/yourusername/2011/
```

Before training you have to convert npz files to npy in a label subfolder:
```
python convert_npz_to_npy.py
```
## Getting DALI
Since it might be the case that GPU support for fits reader haven't been yet officially released, dali is not included in 'requirements.txt'.
There are two ways you can go about it. Either install nightly packages:
```
pip install --extra-index-url https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/redist/nightly --upgrade nvidia-dali-nightly-cuda110
pip install --extra-index-url https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/redist/nightly --upgrade nvidia-dali-tf-plugin-nightly-cuda110

# For more details refer to https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/dali/main-user-guide/docs/installation.html 
```

Or building dali from source:
```
# Assuming dali repository is in `dali` directory and  DALI_deps are installed.

mkdir dali/build && cd dali/build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo-DBUILD_LMDB=ON -DBUILD_CUFILE=ON -DCUDA_TARGET_ARCHS="70" ..
make -j24
pip install ./dali/python
```
More info about installation from source:
https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/dali/user-guide/docs/compilation.html#bare-metal-build

## Usage

To start training:
```
python UNet/train.py
```
If running with DALI for data preprocessing:
```
python UNet/train.py --use_dali
```
To use DALI on GPU backend
```
python UNet/train.py --use_dali --GPU
```
To run benchmarks: 
```
python UNet/benchmark.py
```
## Possible issues

### Tensorflow not detecting GPUs
If tensorflow doesn't detect any GPU's even though there is one (check with 'nvidia-smi' command),
it might be the case that there is mismatch between cudatoolkit version and tensorflow version.
For example, you might have CUDA 12.1 which is yet not supported by the newest version of tf (2.12).

In such case, the recommended solution is to use conda and install appropriate packages in
a conda environment without messing around with system wide installations.

Installation guide for debian/ubuntu with apt:
https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/rpm-debian.html

Here is how to use conda environments:
https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html

Once you are in a conda env install requirements with pip, then
install tensorflow as described here: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip
Finally install dali from source (if fits gpu is yet not released) as described above.

### Running out of memory
If during pipeline execution operators such numpy reader crash due to being unable to
allocate memory, set lower limit for tensorflow in train.py so it doesn't hog all memory for itself:
```
# here memory limit for tensorflow is set to 6gb
            [tf.config.LogicalDeviceConfiguration(memory_limit=1024*6)])
```
Further you can limit batch size in train.py:
```
batch_size = 16
```
